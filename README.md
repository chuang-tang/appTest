testApp Created by Chuang TANG

I built this project in Code::Bolcks in system ubuntu.

This application is dependent on the libraries:

-openFrameworks
-twitcurl

To get this application run, you must download and install the c++ library for twitter api from 

https://code.google.com/p/twitcurl/

The tutoral of installing this library in different OS can be found in:

https://code.google.com/p/twitcurl/wiki/WikiHowToUseTwitcurlLibrary

The head files and Makefile are already in this forder.
